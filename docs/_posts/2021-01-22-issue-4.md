### Discussions

* Lenny [expressed intention](https://llvm.discourse.group/t/generate-spirv-binary-from-mlir-dialect-kernels-to-run-it-on-ocl-runtime/2501/4) to work on OpenCL conversions via SPIR-V and bring up a mlir-opencl-runner.

### Commits

* The SPIR-V dialect now knows traits like [`SignedOp`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94896), [`UnsignedOp`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94068), and [`UsableInSpecConstantOp`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94288) to process ops in these categories uniformly.
* `spv.SpecConstantOperation` is fully supported now, including serialization and deserialization.
